### Summary of the Project

This project aims at implementing speech-to-command feature to allow user to take control on actions of an agent in a world of Minecraft. It will take a speech as initial input, convert that speech to text, analyze text to extract a legal action, and finally send a command for an agent to take that action as an output. Potential application may include partially or fully speech based game playing.

### AI/ML Algorithms

Automatic text classification with hybrid machine learning approach (combination of naive bayes, decision tree, neural nets, and SVM etc..).

### Evaluation Plan

We will make a set of tasks to evaluate the success of our project based on its difficulty to accomplish. The easiest set of actions would be make a single movement (“move forward, right, left, back, jump”). The next level would be some combinatorial actions “turn right and keep going straight, move right and jump etc..”. And the next one would be approach/attack/collect a closest object/target (“attack it, collect it, approach to it”) etc.. To make it quantitative, we can conduct hundred times of experiment and see the successful rate. i.e. for the task for the agent “going straight”, we should be able to see the agent command is “going straight” by inputting the speech “going straight (or it’s variant)”.
